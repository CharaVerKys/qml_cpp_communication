## qml_cpp_communication
my implementation of frontend-backend connection between qml and cpp context  
*using only qml context property*

### overall
if you want look at lacks of this strategy see:  
https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-cppintegration-contextproperties.html  
  
---
meanwhile code itself is fine and works as expected  
works on clang  
feel free to contribute to connection system  

### extra
i not looked at qml singleton (as cpp object) because i got bored at reading documentation  
**no ai involved in design or codding**  
*not all project files provided, only connection relevant part*
